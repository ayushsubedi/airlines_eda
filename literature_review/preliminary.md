# Preliminary Literature Review

## A Data Mining Approach to Flight Arrival Delay Prediction for American Airline 

- American Airlines delays prediction using Gradient Boosting Classifier covering the top five US airports. 

- The accuracy achieved using Gradient Boosting Classifier is 85.73%. This can serve us as a baseline as we explore other classification algorithms. Additionally, this paper explores sampling techniques (such as R-SMOTE) to handle imbalance in classes. A similar strategy is required in our case as well. 

- A more scientific/data-driven approach on feature selection might lead to a greater accuracy score. Similarly, XGboost, Deep Learning algorithm and other classification algorithms might lead to better classifier. Our dataset has more features and more data points. We also intend to perform dimensionality reduction, clustering, and regression. 

## Systemic delay propagation in the US airport network 

- The paper studies technical, operational, or meteorological issues propagating delays across the US airport network. The paper also establishes passenger and crew connectivity as the most relevant factor for delay spreading. 

- We intend to study the cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others, and therefore the ideas laid here are relevant to us. 

- The paper establishes passenger and crew connectivity as the most relevant factor for delay spreading. However, the paper only limits itself to 2010. We want to explore if this is relevant in the recent years (and during Covid) as well. 

## Flight delay prediction from spatial and temporal perspective 

- The paper proposes a novel Spatial Temporal Random Forest for flight delay prediction on China domestic flights between June and August 2016 samples. 

- We intend to experiment with some aspects of prediction on a spatial and temporal level within the different airports in the United States. This paper presents an effective approach. 

- Shortcomings not applicable here.
