# Preliminary Literature Review

## A Data Mining Approach to Flight Arrival Delay Prediction for American Airline

(a) the main idea
- American Airlines delay classifier using Gradient Boosting Classifer covering the top five US airports

(b) why (or why not) it will be useful for your project, and
- The accuracy acheived here using Gradient Boosting Classifier is 85.73%. This can serve us as a baseline as we explore other classification algorithms. We plan on using more features and more data points, and we think we can improve on this. Additionally, this paper explores sampling techniques (such as R-SMOTE) to handle imbalance in classes. A similar strategy is required in our case as well.

(c) its potential shortcomings, that you will try to improve upon
- A more scientific/data-driven approach on feature selection might lead to greater accuracy score. XGboost and Deep Learning algorithm might lead to better accuracy score. Additionally, our dataset has more features and more data points.
