# Proposal

### Proposal requirements
- At least one **large, real dataset**
- Some **non-trivial** analysis/computation/algorithms performed on the dataset
- an **interactive** user interface that interacts with the algorithm
- should describe what you plan to do (the problem to address), why you want to do it, how you will do it (what tools? e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, Kinect, iPad, etc.), how your approach is better than the state of the art, why it may succeed, and when it does, what differences will it make, how you will measure success, how long it's gonna take, etc.

### 9 Heilmeier questions
- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
- How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?
- What's new in your approach? Why will it be successful?
- Who cares?
- If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?
- What are the risks and payoffs?
- How much will it cost?
- How long will it take?
- What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured?

# Possible Problem Statements

The problem statements are from https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009

- When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
- Do older planes suffer more delays?
- How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
- How well does weather predict plane delays?
- Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?
